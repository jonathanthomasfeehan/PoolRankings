# Pool Rankings

Pool Rankings is a project designed to calculate and manage player rankings for pool games. It provides tools to track player performance, calculate Elo ratings, and generate leaderboards.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to gain more experience coding and learning new technologies. Over the course of development I have gained experience working with containerized applications both for local and cloud deployment, I have pushed myself to explore better practices and naming conventions and most recently I have learned to take advantage of tools such as copilot to be more efficent in my time. As this project goes on I will continue learning as many lessons from the experience as I can.
